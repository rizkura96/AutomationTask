## 📑 About the Test

<p align="justify">The test consists of 2, namely automation tasks and general assessments, but I took the initiative to add postman documentation to facilitate visualization of the API response. For the Automation Task, you can clone this repository and open / run it using IntelliJ IDEA via the terminal with the command "mvn clean verify", after the testing process is complete you can regenerate the report via the link and it will direct you to the Serenity BDD Report Dashboard.

And for the general assessment, you can see the results in the "general-assessment" folder or you can also click this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MOKkTytWd3IIzFKm4sxBu73n_asa8OvH/view?usp=drive_link</p>
